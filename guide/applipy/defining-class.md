# Defining a Class
Classes are the basis of Object-Oriented Programming or OOP, and allow a user to store data and functions unique to a real-world object. Using classes, you can do things such as create objects and perform operations on them using functions built into the class. 

In the above example, any methods built into the Food class can be done to any of the objects. 

For example, if a Slice method was created in the Food class, this could be done to any of the objects. 

**Methods** that are built into classes can also accept parameters and can return values just like functions. 

> You have actually already used methods - remember the [string methods](/intropy/consoleio#methods) from Intro to Python?

# Syntax

Remember that **classes contain variables and methods**, which determine how the class interacts with other classes.

Classes are defined like this: 

```python
class ClassName:
	class_variables = "something"
	def __init__(self, params):
		self.attributes = "something else"
	def methods(params):
		…
```

Here is an example of a class in Python:

```python
class Python: 
  species = "Python anchietae"
  common_name = "Angolan Python"
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  def hiss(self):
    print("hisssss")
  def birthday(self):
    self.age += 1
    print(f"Happy {self.age}th Birthday, {self.name}!")
```

In this example, we create a new class called Python and give it several attributes (that a real python would have): `species`, `common_name`, `name`, and `age`. 

Notice that `species` and `common_name` are defined outside of the initiator class. This is because all pythons have these attributes. 

However, `name` and `age` are defined inside the initiator, because they may vary from python to python (Not all pythons are the same age, and not every python will be called the same name). 

> Note that we can still access `species` and `common_name` from self.

To define an object of a class, you must put the name of the object and set it equal to the class name followed by parentheses with the parameters. Parameters are only given if the class has an initiator with parameters, and the parameters go in the parentheses. The format is as the following:
`Object = ClassName(parameter)`

For example, to define an object of the Python class above:

```python
Monty = Python(‘Monty’, 14)
```
The name would be ‘Monty’, and the age would be 14. To use a method you need to use the object’s name followed by a period and the name of the method. 

The format is as the following:

```
Monty.hiss()
>>> hisssss
```

Methods are defined the same way [functions](/intropy/functions) are defined, but they need to be one indent away from the definition of the class. 

Notice that all methods, even those that do not take other parameters, take the parameter `self`. `self` represents the instance of the class, and allows its methods to access its attributes and methods. `self` doesn't necessarily need to be called `self`, but it must be the first parameter of the methods. Generally, we call it `self` by convention. 

The initiator method is always run when a class is defined, and it is defined in a class with `__init__` and accepts any parameters so long as they are built into the method with parentheses just as you would build parameters into a function. In the previous Python example, the initiator method accepts the values name and age, and stores the data for the class to use in the future. Once the data is stored, it can then be changed and used later on in the class, as shown in the birthday method. 

The `__init__` function is called when an object is created: 
```python
my_snake = Python("Horace", 4)
my_snake.birthday()
```
```
>>> Happy 5th Birthday, Horace!
```

Data in classes is commonly stored in class variables which all have to be defined in the initiator function. The first variable defined during class methods represents the object itself inside the class, and it is typically named self but it doesn’t have to be. In the code above, in lines 5 and 6, we use the self parameter to create a class variable that is unique to an object defined with the set of parameters that was given. 

To change a class variable, you would need to use the object's name, a period `.`, and the name of the variable. Then just set it equal to any value you want as long as the methods will still work with what you change it to.

The format is as the following:

```python
my_snake.age = 15
```

You can access public attributes of a class just like you can modify them:

```python
print(my_snake.age)
>>> 15
```

To define private and protected members of a class, you can put a underscore `_`, or two underscores `__` in front. 

```python
class Python: 
  species = "Python anchietae"
  common_name = "Angolan Python"
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.__name = name
    self.age = age
  def hiss(self):
    print("hisssss")
  def birthday(self):
    self.age += 1
    print(f"Happy {self.age}th Birthday, {self.name}!")

my_snake = Python("Horace", 4)
print(my_snake.__name)
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 14, in <module>
    print(my_snake.__name)
AttributeError: 'Python' object has no attribute '__name'
```

Notice that an error is raised because `name` is private, meaning that `name` cannot be used outside of the class. 
You can learn more about them [here](object-oriented).

# Implementing Classes

Consider a plant. In the previous lesson, you learn how to efine the methods and attributes of the plant. Now, we'll implement that as a class:

```python
class Plant:
  def __init__(self, species, age, height):
    self.species = species
    self.age = age
    self.height = height
  def grow(self):
    self.height += 1
```

Define some other methods or attributes that a `Plant` might have, and add them as methods or attributes.
