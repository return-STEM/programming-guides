# The Need for Loops

* When you are writing programs, often you will want to perform the same action many times.
* This can be done with loops and will result in having to write less code
* For example, consider the following prompt:
	* *Write a program to print all nonnegative integers lower than a number chosen by the user using `input()`.*
* This problem involves using the `print()` statement several times
  * The amount of times would **change based on user input**
* One method of doing this is the *`while` loop*.

# Structure of loops

* A loop contains a **header** and a **body**
  * The **header** dictates how the loop behaves (how to loop)
  * The **body** is indented (just like an if statement) and contains the code that is to be executed each time the loop "loops"
    * A single "loop" of a loop is called an **iteration** or **cycle**

```python
while (condition):             # Header
    print("Loop body")         # Body
    print("I am inside loop")  # Body
print("Outside loop")          # Outside of body
```

```python
for item in iterable:          # Header
    print("Loop body")         # Body
    print("I am inside loop")  # Body
print("Outside loop")          # Outside of body
```
# The `while` Loop

The basic syntax of the `while` loop is:

```python
while (condition):
	do this
	execute more statements
```

* First, the loop checks whether the condition after the `while` keyword is `True`.
  * **If** it is `True`, it executes all statements inside the body of the loop.
* Then, it goes back to the header, checks if the condition is `True`, and executes the body if it is
* This cycle repeats until the condition becomes `False`
  * When it is, it will skip the body and continue executing the rest of the program
* You can think about while loops like this:*Execute all the statements in the body **while** the **condition is** true.*

## While Loop Diagram

	while a < 10:
	print(b)
	a += c
```

## Stopping `while` Loops

`while` Loops need to be stopped to prevent an infinite loop

An infinite loop is a while loop in which the given condition is never false, such as:

The variable for the condition is never being changed, and the condition will be true forever.

Infinite loops resulting in the contents of the while loop repeating until the program crashes or is stopped.

```python
i = 0
while i == 0:
	print("This is an infinite loop")
```

This program will output “this is an Infinite Loop”) until it is stopped or it crashes

# `break` and `continue`

There are other ways to stop or change while loops without changing the condition, the `break` statement and the `continue` statement.

The `break` statement stops the while loop when the code reaches it, even if the condition is met.

```python
 i = 1
 while i > 0:
     print("This is an Infinite Loop")
     if i == 5:
         break
     i += 1
```

This program will output “This is an Infinite Loop”) 5 times and then stop.

The `continue` statement will stop the current iteration(repetition) of the while loop and move on to the next one.

```python
 i = 0
 while i < 10:
     i += 1
     if i == 5:
         continue
     print(i)
```

This program will output the numbers from 1 to 10 but skip 5.

## Ending while Loops

The `else` statement can be used at the end of while loops to output something else when the condition is no longer true.

**The** **`else`** **clause will only run if the loop doesn't** **`break`** **prematurely**

```python
 i = 0
 while i < 10:
     i += 1
     print(i)
 else:
	   print(“The numbers 1-10 have been printed”)

```
This program will output the numbers 1-10 and then print “The numbers 1-10 have been printed”

## `while` Loop: Example

Here’s an example of a `while` loop, solving the problem presented earlier:


```
x = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
while x > 0:
	x -= 1
	print(x)
```

First, the loop takes the user’s input using `input()`.

Afterwards, it executes the `while` loop:First, the loop checks if x is greater than zero. If it is, it subtracts 1 from x, and prints it. Then, it repeats this process. When x is zero, the loop ends. Since there are no more lines in the program, the program is finished.

## `while` Loop Practice

What is a common way to create an infinite loop?

When does a while loop check the condition?
	a. Once, when the loop is started
	b. Twice, at the start and end of the loop
	c. Infinite times until the condition is not met or the loop is broken
	d. Never, it is there just for show

# Tracing Loops

When you’re debugging a very straightforward program like this:

```python
 a = input()
 b = input()
 print(a / b)
```

It’s quite intuitive - you can simply look at each line of the code and see whether it works or not.

However, for loops, this is not the case sometimes.

Many times, when beginners write programs, their problems lie within loops, because they do not follow through each loop.

When going through a loop, remember that the loop only checks for the condition *at the start of an iteration*

Sometimes your loop may not run at all because the initial condition is not satisfied when the program reaches the loop code

We can use a **trace table** to better analyze looping code:

```python
i = 4
j = 0
while (j < 3):
	i += 1
    j += 1
print(i + j)
```

| Iteration | Statement | Value | Explanation |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | i += 1 | i = 5, j = 0 | Since j < 3 is True, Python enters the loop. |
| 1 | j += 1 | i = 5, j = 1 |  |
| 2 | i += 1 | i = 6, j = 1 | j < 3 is still True, so Python repeats the code. |
| 2  | j += 1 | i = 6, j = 2 |  |
| 3 | i += 1 | i = 7, j = 2 | j < 3 is still True, so Python repeats the code again. |
| 3 | j += 1 | i = 7, j = 3 |  |
| END | N/A | i = 7, j = 3 | j < 3 is now False, so Python stops the loop. |

# The `for` Loop

The `while` loop executes the content inside the loop while certain conditions are met.

The `for` loop iterates (walks) through a list, string, dictionary, or other data structure

> If something is able to be iterated (walked through a piece at a time) through, it is classified as **iterable**

Example of an iterable:

![](loops/loops-6-iterables-1.png)

The `for` loop goes across each element of the sequence, after executing the body of the loop every time it moves on to a new element.

```python
for element in iterable:
	execute body of the code
```

First, we will cover for loops across a range of numbers.
## The `for` loop over a range of numbers

To iterate through a set of numbers, you can use the `range()` function.

The basic format is:

```python
for i in range(start, end, increment):
	body_of_loop
```

> **`start`:** Starting value, inclusive
> 
> **`end`:** Ending value, exclusive
> 
> **`increment`:** How much to increase by

For example, this code goes through 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

![](loops/loops-6-iterables-1-2.png)

```python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
	body_of_loop
```

If you only give one number, it will use that number as `end` and use `start = 0` and `increment = 1`.

If you only give two, it will use the first as `start` and the second as `end` and `increment`  will default to 1.

### Examples

```python
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
	# body_of_loop
	# Iterates through 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

for i in range(0, 10):
	# body_of_loop
	# Iterates through 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

for i in range(10):
	# body_of_loop
	# Iterates through 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

for i in range(5, 0, -1):
	#body_of_loop
	# Iterates through 5,4,3,2,1
```

## Algorithms with Loops: `for` loops
Given the loop to the left, let’s see what python does when going through it

```python
for i in range(0, 6):
	print(i)
```

| `i =` | Statement | Explanation |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | print(i) | First, Python starts the loop with i = 0. It then executes print(i). Since there is no more in the body, the loop then goes to the next value of i. |
| 1 | print(i) | i = 1,so it does print(i), and goes to the next value. |
| 2 | print(i) | i = 2, so it does print(i), and goes to the next value. |
| 3 | print(i) | i = 3, so it does print(i), and goes to the next value. |
| 4 | print(i) | i = 4, so it does print(i), and goes to the next value. |
| 5 | print(i) | i = 5, so it does print(i), and there are no more values. |
| END | N/A | Since there are no more values, the loop ends. |

## The `for` Loop Over a String

In the previous lessons, you learned that you can access the characters of a string by using `str_name[index]`. Remember that indices start from 0.

For example:

```python
s = "Hello World"
s[0]
>>> H
s[1]
>>> e
s[5]
>>>  
s[6]
>>> W
```

To iterate through a string, you can create a loop which iterates through a set of numbers, then use those numbers to reference each character:

Remember that you can use `len(s)` to get the length of the string s.

```python
s = "Hello World"
for i in range(len(s)):
	print(s[i])
```

This code will output `"Hello World"` with each character on its own line.

While it is possible to use `range()`, Python has a built in method to iterate over a string:

```python
s = "Hello World"
for i in s:
	print(i)
```

In this example, `i` will take on each character of the string `s` each time the body of the loop is executed.

```python
s = "Hello World"
for i in range(len(s)):
	print(s[i])
```

This method does the same thing as the method presented in the last slide, but is simpler and easier to read.

## `break`,  `continue`, and `else`
## `break` in `for` loops

If you want a for loop to prematurely end, you can use the keyword `break`.

```python
 s = 'Python' for letter in s:     if letter == 'h':         break
     print("Current letter", letter)
 >>>	Current letter: P
 >>>	Current letter: y
 >>>	Current letter: t

```
In this code, the code iterates through the letters of the string `s` until reaching `'h'`.

When the code reaches `'h'`,  the loop is broken and the code stops.

## `continue` in `for` loops

For loops can also use the `continue` keyword and in for loops this keyword can skip over a current iteration.

```python
 s = 'Python' for letter in s:     if letter == 'h':         continue
     print("Current letter", letter)
 >>>	Current letter: P
 >>>	Current letter: y
 >>>	Current letter: t
 >>>	Current letter: o
 >>>	Current letter: n

```
In this example, the for loops iterates through each letter in the string s but skips h as the `if` statement followed by the `continue` keyword skips that iteration of the string.

## `else` in for loops

The else keyword can be used in for loops to print something when the loop is done, **if the loop does not exit prematurely with** **`break`**

This can be used to output a final remark once the loop is done without incorporating an `if` statement in your loop.

These two blocks of code output the same thing, but the use of the `else` statement is shorter and easire to read.

```python
 for i in range(10):
    print(i)
 else:
    print(“Those were the numbers 0-9”)
```

```python
 for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    if i == 9:
       print(“Those were the numbers 0-9)
```

This code prints the letters 0 through 9 with the `for` loop and then prints 10 with the `else` statement.

## `for` Loop Practice
Which use of the range function goes through every odd number from 1-20?
	a. `for i in range(20, 2)`
	b. `for i in range(1, 20, 2)`
	c. `for i in range(1, 20, 1)`
	d. `for i in range(20, 1)

Which data type can a for loop not iterate through?
	a. Strings
	b. Lists
	c. Integers

# Which type of loop should I use?

* Number of iterations
  * In a while loop the number of iterations is unknown
  * In a for loop the number of iterations should be already known
* What a while loop is better at
  * Asking for user input
  * When the increment isn’t increasing by a standard amount each time
* What a for loop is better at
  * Iterating through a list, string, etc.
  * Iterating through a sequence of numbers

# `if` statement inside of `while`/`for` loops
In previous examples, you'll see that we included `if` statements inside of loops.

`if` statements simply check for the condition, every time to loop runs

You still need to indent specifically for the `if` statement.

```python
s = 'Python'
for letter in s:
	if letter == 'h':
		break
    print("Current letter", letter)

>>> Current letter: P
>>> Current letter: y
>>> Current letter: t
```

You can use `if` statements to check for certain conditions and end loops early, or do operations on specific characters (the character is equal to `"a"`, etc.)
# Nested loops
You can also have loops inside of loops to repeat complex tasks multiple times.

The inner loop would be fully executed every time the outer loop cycles (iterates) one time.

```python
days_of_week = 'MTWHF'
for weeks_of_month in range(1,5):
	print("week " + str(weeks_of_month))
	for day in days_of_week:
		print(day)

>>> week 1 # Outer Loop iterates once
>>> M # Inner Loop iteration 1
>>> T # Inner Loop iteration 2
>>> W # Inner Loop iteration 3
>>> H # Inner Loop iteration 4
>>> F # Inner Loop iteration 5
>>> week 2 # Outer loop iterates once
>>> M # Inner Loop iteration 1
>>> T # Inner Loop iteration 2
>>> W # Inner Loop iteration 3
>>> H # Inner Loop iteration 4
>>> F # Inner Loop iteration 5
>>> week 3 # Outer loop iterates once
>>> M # Inner Loop iteration 1
>>> T # Inner Loop iteration 2
>>> W # Inner Loop iteration 3
>>> H # Inner Loop iteration 4
>>> F # Inner Loop iteration 5
>>> week 4 # Outer loop iterates once
>>> M # Inner Loop iteration 1
>>> T # Inner Loop iteration 2
>>> W # Inner Loop iteration 3
>>> H # Inner Loop iteration 4
>>> F # Inner Loop iteration 5

```

# Defensive Programming
* Any program you write that requires user input should be **defensive**
  * They should be able to deal with any input the user enters, even if it is invalid
    * The program should not crash whenever the user enters invalid input
* This can be done using `if` statements to check user input and `while` loops to restart the program

```python
while True:
    x = input("Please enter a three letter word")
    if len(x) == 3:
        break
    print("The word you entered is not three letters long. Please try again")
# Do something with the three letter word
# We now know for sure it is three letters and a string
```



You can and should perform any check that may crash the program:

```python
print("This program does division for you")
while True:
	x = input("Enter a positive integer dividend: ")
	y = input("Enter a positive integer divisor: ")
	if not (x.isnumeric() and y.isnumeric()):
		print("Please enter numbers")
		continue
	# Now we know x and y can be safely casted to integers without crashing
	x = int(x)
	y = int(y)
	if y == 0:
		print("Your divisor cannot be zero")
		continue
	# If we pass all above checks, we can break out of the input loop
	break
# Now we can safely divide by y without possibly causing ZeroDivisionError
print(x / y)
**
```
