# What are lists?
![](lists/lists-7-example.png)

**Lists** are an ordered collection of items.
Each individual item inside the list is called an **element**

These items can be:
- Integers/floats/booleans
- Strings
- Other data types

**If variables are boxes, a list would be a shelf which you place the boxes on.**

# Why Use Lists?
**Lists** offer a useful way to organize data where there is a variable number of entries and perform the same task on a lot of grouped data.

For example, let’s say that I have a couple of lists to represent some information about a student at a school.

```python
name = "John"
grade = 8
scores = [98.0, 93.0, 87.5, 100.0]
attendance = [True, False, True, True, True]

```

It becomes much easier to find John’s average score, or find how many days he has missed class.

# List Syntax

Lists are declared like variables, but use square brackets \[] around everything within them:

```python
list1 = ["cat", "dog", "cow"]
# assigns the strings cat, dog, and cow to list1.
```

Each separate item inside the list is separated by commas. Here's a list containing integers from 0 to 9:

```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
# Indices
Each item in the list has an **index** that describes its position in the list. This is similar to someone's position in line--if you're first in line, you are at the front of the line.

However, in programming, the **first element in the list has the index 0.**

> This is called **zero-indexing**, where zero is the first value of a sequence of numbers (count starting from zero)

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
#           ^    ^    ^    ^
#           0    1    2    3
```

## Negative indices

Positive indices reference elements from *left to right*.

Negative indices start from the opposite side, from right to left.

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
#           ^    ^    ^    ^
#           -4    -3    -2   -1
```

-1 is the *last* element of the list

-3 is the *third to last* element of the list

# Getting and Setting Elements

To retrieve a single list **element**, use the list name followed by the element's index in square brackets. For example, `my_list[1]` returns `'b'` because  `'b'` is the second (index 1) element in the list.
- `x = list[0]` sets variable `x` to `'a',` the first element (index 0) in the list

You can also set individual elements as well using this technique
- `my_list[2] = 'y'` sets the third element (index 2) to `'y'`
- `my_list` now has the value `['a', 'b', 'y', 'd']`

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
#           ^    ^    ^    ^
#           0    1    2    3
```

## List Slicing

Just like in strings, lists can also be **sliced**. Slicing effectively *creates a new list* using a part of the original list.
  - It **does not mutate** the original list

![](lists/lists5.png)

The syntax looks like this:

`list_name[start:end]` where `start` and `end` are both indices

```python
lst = [50, 70, 30, 20, 90, 10, 50]
print(lst[1:5])
>>> [70, 30, 20, 90]
```

> Remember that `start` is inclusive, but `end` is exclusive.
>
> Omitting `end` like `list_name[start:]` will make the code slice till the end of the list
> 
> Meanwhile, omitting `start`, like `list_name[:end]` will make the code slice from the beginning

## Indices Practice

```python
nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'cow', 'sheep', 'pig']
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'lemon', 'tomato']
```
Using the declarations above, evaluate:

1. `nums[1]`
2. `animals[4]`
3. `fruits[-2]`
4. `nums[-1]`
5. `fruits[3]`
6. `nums[1:5]`
7. `animals[0:2]`
8. `fruits[1:]`
9. `nums[:5]`

## `len()`

To get the length of a list, you can use `len()`.

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print(len(my_list))
>>> 4
```

This also works for strings:

```python
my_str = "Hello World"
print(len(my_str))
>>> 11
```

## Debug-printing lists

Lists can be directly printed out like this:

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print(my_list)
>>> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

However, this might not be the best way you would like to present your information, since the format cannot be changed.
	
> We call this **debug logging**, since this would not be used in a real application; it's only for us to see what's going on in our code.

One way to print out lists in a better way is to *iterate* through each element and print them out individually.

# Iterating through lists

Iterating through lists can be useful to perform the same operation on every element of the list (such as `print()`, but could also be mathematical functions, checking for a condition, etc.)

You already know how to use for loops to go through a series of numbers, so you could do the following to iterate (go through all the elements) through a list:

```python
my_list = ["orange", "apple", "pear", "banana", "kiwi"]
for i in range(0, len(my_list)):
    print(my_list[i])

>>> orange
>>> apple
>>> pear
>>> banana
>>> kiwi

```
## `for` loop short syntax
There’s a shortcut for the code presented in the last slide:

```python
my_list = ["orange", "apple", "pear", "banana", "kiwi"]
for i in my_list:
    print(i)

>>> orange
>>> apple
>>> pear
>>> banana
>>> kiwi

```

In the previous method, you were cycling through numbers, and using numbers to reference elements in the list. Now you are directly cycling through the elements of the list without having to worry about indices.

> **You cannot use this type of loop to change the values inside a list.**

# List Methods & Operations
## `.pop()`

To delete a single element from a list, you can use the `.pop()` function. For example, `letters.pop(2)` deletes the item at the second index (3rd element).
- Notice that this shifts all indexes after the deleted item:
- Before: `letters[0] = "a", letters[1] = "b", letters[2] = "c", letters[3] = "d"`
- After: `letters[0] = "a", letters[1] = "b", letters[2] = "d"`

```python
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
letters.pop(2)
print(letters)
Output:
['a', 'b', 'd']

```

## .append()

To add an element to the end of the list, you can use` .append()`Just like `.pop()`, use it after the name of the list, with the value you want to append.

For example, to append `'e'` to the end of the list `letters`, you can use `letters.append(‘e’)`

```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
letters.append('e')
print(letters)
>>> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

## List Operators: * and +

Similar to strings, `+` and `*` can be used on lists

`+` concatenates two lists together

`*` repeats a list multiple times

```python
 word = ['racecar']
 print(word * 4)
 >>>['racecar', 'racecar', 'racecar', 'racecar']
 print(['racecar', 'bus'] + ['train'])
 >>>['racecar', 'bus', 'train']
 print([1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6])
 >>>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 # Notice that the values are not added together,  instead the lists are.
```

## `in`

- While `in` is a keyword when writing `for` loops, you can also use it to check whether an element is present in the list
  - `in` returns `True` if the value is in the list/string and `False` if the value is not

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
print('a' in my_list)
>>>True
```
This also works for strings:

```python
my_str = "Hello World"
print('o' in "Hello World")
>>>True
```
# Tuples

While you explore more libraries, you will find that many functions return a special data type called a **tuple**. Tuples are declared like lists, but use `()` instead of `[]`.

These data types behave like lists, but are **immutable*** *(cannot be changed)*. Therfore, you cannot reassign values in a tuple, and the size of a tuple cannot change.


Reference a tuple's elements just like you would in a list:

```python
my_tuple = (0, "apple", 2)
print(my_tuple[1])
>>> apple
```

Keywords like `in` and functions like `len()` can also be used on tuples

```python
animals = ("pig", "cow", "sheep")
print("cow" in animals)
>>> True
```

You can use `list()` to convert a tuple to a list

```python
animals = ("pig", "cow", "sheep")
print(animals)
print(list(animals))
>>> ('cow', 'pig', 'sheep')
>>> ['cow', 'pig', 'sheep']

```

# List Input and Output
## Inputting into lists
### On one line

You cannot directly input lists with `input()`, since python believes that it is a string:

```python
my_input = input("Enter input: ")
print(type(my_input))
Enter input: [1, 2, 3]
<class 'str'>
```

Instead, you can have the user input each element of the list with a space in between, using the `.split()` method on `input()`.

```python
my_input = input("Enter input: ").split()
print(type(my_input))
print(my_input)

>>> Enter input: 1 2 3
>>> <class 'list'>
>>> ['1', '2', '3']
```

If you put nothing in `.split()`, it will split the string by spaces. However, you can choose to include a string inside of `.split()` to tell it what to split by.

### Multiline Input

Another method of inputting values into a list could be on multiple lines, using `input()` many times with a loop.

In this method, we can use a loop, after getting how many elements will be inputted.

```python
reps = input("How many inputs? ")
my_list = []
for i in range(reps):
    ele = input()
    my_list.append(ele)
print(my_list)

>>> How many inputs? 3
>>> 1
>>> 2
>>> 3
>>> ['1', '2', '3']
```

### Casting an entire list

Notice that when you used `input().split()` to get inputs into a list from the user, everything was a string.

However, you can't use `int()` on `input()` like earlier, since `int()` cannot cast spaces and other formatting.

One way to do this is to *iterate* through each element, and change their type one by one.

```python
vals = ["1", "2", "4", "3"]
print(vals)
for v in range(len(vals)):
	vals[v] = int(vals[v])
print(vals)
>>> ['1', '2', '4', '3']
>>> [1, 2, 4, 3]
```

## Outputting a list

When using `print()` on a list, you'll notice that it prints it with brackets and commas.

If you don't want that, you can do

`string.join(list_name)`

`string` is what should be in between the printed elements, usually `' '` for our purposes:

```python
words = ["quickly", "scurry", "and", "find", "freedom"]
sentence = ' '.join(words)
print(sentence)
other_sentence = ', '.join(words)
print(other_sentence)
>>> quickly scurry and find freedom
>>> quickly, scurry, and, find, freedom
```

# Multidimensional Lists
Lists can also have multiple dimensions (2D, 3D, 4D).  You can do this by putting lists inside of lists, like this:
```
[["r1c1", "r1c2"], ["r2c1", "r2c2"]]
```

|  | Element  0 | Element 1 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| List 0 | "r1c1" | "r1c2" |
| List 1 | "r2c1" | "r2c2" |

This list has two lists inside of it that are two elements long (it is "2 by 2"). It behaves like a 2-dimensional table, with rows and columns.

Elements can be addressed by indexing twice (`my_list[row][col]`)

Multidimensional lists can be used to model many real-world things. Tables and graphs are all 2-dimensional data that can be modeled with multidimensional lists

You can also make 3, 4, and 5 dimensional lists (and so on)
Put list inside of lists inside of lists until you haveachieved the number of desired dimensions

## Example

You can represent a seating chart through a multidimensional list:

```python
seating_chart = [
    ["Nobody", "Tim", "Sally", "Ben"],
    ["Arnav", "Jason", "Mary", "Rav"],
    ["Aditya", "Nobody", "Samantha", "Lee"]
    ["Joshua", "Tyrone", "Adam", "Aarav"]
    ["Ethan", "Lilly", "Daryl", "Danny"]
]
# Print the person sitting in the first row and first column
print(seating_chart[0][0])
>>> Nobody
# Print the person sitting in the third row and fourth column
print(seating_chart[2][3]
>>> Lee

```

## Iterating through multidimensional lists
You can iteratively print values of a list:

```
for i in range(len(list)): print(i)
```

However, if you did this using a multidimensional list, it would print simply the lists inside, rather than each individual value

```python
two_d_list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
for i in range(len(two_d_list)):
	print(two_d_list[i])
>>> [1,2,3]
>>> [4,5,6]
>>> [7,8,9]

```

We can solve this with nested loops. A nested loop can iterate through multidimensional lists. The list [1,2,3] inside **two_d_list** is actually `two_d_list[0]`. Similarly, [4,5,6] is `two_d_list[1]` and [7,8,9] is `two_d_list[2]`

An outer loop will retrieve the lists inside the combined list
An inner loop will retrieve the values inside the inner lists

The inner loop will iterate through `two_d_list[i]`, or every list that is inside the combined list

```python
two_d_list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
for i in range(len(two_d_list)):
	for j in range(len(two_d_list[i])):
		# New - prints on the same line
		print(two_d_list[i][j], end = “ ”)
		# Have we reached the last element?
		# Then prints a new line
		if j == len(two_d_list[i])-1:
			print(“”)
>>> 1 2 3
>>> 4 5 6
>>> 7 8 9
```

### Trace Table
| Iteration | Value of loop variables | Value printed |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | i = 0, j = 0 | 1 |
| 1 | i = 0, j = 1 | 2 |
| 1 | i = 0, j = 2 | 3 |
| 2  | i = 1, j = 0 | 4 |
| 2 | i = 1, j = 1 | 5 |
| 2 | i = 1, j = 2 | 6 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 3 | i = 2, j = 0 | 7 |
| 3 | i = 2, j = 1 | 8 |
| 3 | i = 2, j = 2 | 9 |

# List Methods
| Function | Usage | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| len() | Returns the length of the list | len([0, 1, 2]) returns 3 |
| max() | Returns the largest value of the list | max([1, 9, 3]) returns 9 |
| min() | Returns the smallest value of the list | min([1, 9, 3]) returns 1 |
| .pop() | Removes the element at the specified index, then returns it | [1, 2, 3].pop(1) returns 2and changes list to [1, 3] |
| .append() | Adds the element to the end of the list | [1, 2, 3].append(4) changes list to [1, 2, 3, 4] |
| .sort() | Sorts the list from least to greatest | [5, 6, 2].sort() changes list to [2, 5, 6]  |
