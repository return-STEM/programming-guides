# The Problem
* Write a program that, given a fahrenheit temperature reading from a thermometer, tells the user whether the patient has a healthy body temperature or not.
  * (Assume that a temperature over or equal to 100℉ indicates a fever)
* You already know how to:
* Take an input from the user and assign it to a variable
* Print out information for the user to see through the consoleHow can you make the program change what it does, based off of what the user types in?
* One way is to use __if/else statements__:

To solve our problem, we have decided to use  __if/else statements__ . But how exactly do these  __if/else statements__  work?

# If/Else structure
![](conditionals/python-4-if.png)
# Syntax
The if statement is structured like this:
```python
if (condition):   
	do this
```

When the condition is `True`, the statements under the indent are executed.

If it is `False`, the statements under the indent are ignored.
```python
num = int(input())
if num > 10:
	print(“Greater than 10”)
```

The condition does not need to be surrounded in parenthesis, but it can be.

# Indents in Python
When writing programs in Python, you’ll notice that some lines of code are  _indented_ .

```python
num = int(input())
if (condition):
	do this # Indented
```
Indented lines are used to tell python which lines are part of the if statement and should be executed, like this:


```python
condition = True

if (condition):    
	print(“Part of the if statement”)    
	print(“Also part of the if statement”)
	a = 3 + 5 * 4 # Also part of the if statement
print(“This is outside the indent, so it is not part of the if statement.”)
# Statements after the indent are always executed.
```

# Comparison Operators
You learned that `=` is the assignment operator, and does not mean _equal to_ .

In Python, `==` is the equivalence operator:`5 == 5` is `True`

`5 == 2` is `False`

For not equals, we use `!=`:
`5 != 5` is `False`

`5 != 2` is `True`

Greater than and Less than operators also work just like in math:	
`5 < 8` is `True`
`5 > 2` is `True`

Finally, Greater than or equal to and less than or equal to use `>=` and `<=`:
`5 <= 5` is `True`
`5 <= 8` is `True`

## Comparison Operators Reference
> Assume `a = 10` and `b = 20`

| Symbol | Operator | Definition | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| ==  | Equal To  | If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true. | (a == b) is not true. |
| !=  | Not Equal To | If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true. | (a != b) is true. |
| > | Greater Than | If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a > b) is not true. |
| < | Less Than | If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a < b) is true. |
| >= | Greater Than or Equal To | If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a >= b) is not true. |
| <= | Less Than or Equal To | If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a <= b) is true. |

## Comparison Operators Practice
Evaluate each of the Python expressions:

1. `5 == "5"
2. `3 != 5 - 2`
3. `5.0 == 5`
4. `True == "True"`
5. `False == "False"`
6. `5 > 3``
7. `8 <= 8`

# Solving the problem

Write a program that, given a Fahrenheit temperature reading from a thermometer, tells the user whether the patient has a healthy body temperature or not.

Let's solve this problem step by step:

We can see that we need user input, so we need to first store an input inside of a variable, then cast it into a float.

`body_temp = float(input())`

* Next, we need to check if the number is greater than 100. We can use an `if` statement for this:
* How can we modify the code so that it prints `Healthy` if the body temperature is not greater than 100?

```python
body_temp = float(input())
if body_temp > 100:    
	print(“Not Healthy”)`
```

# Logical Operators

Operators that deal with boolean values are called  __logical operators__

There are three basic logical operators

| Operator | Definition | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `and` | If both the operands are true then condition becomes true. | True and True → True |
| `or` | If any of the two operands are non-zero then condition becomes true. | True or False → True |
| `not` | Used to reverse the logical state of its operand. | not (True or False) → False |

* Logical operators also have an order of precedence
  * Parenthesis > `not` > `and` > `or`

## The `and` Operator

The “`and`” operator can return either `True` or `False`

You can think of it this way:
I want you to give me an apple and a banana.
- I would not be satisfied with just an apple and no banana (False)
- I would not be satisfied with just a banana and no apple (False)
- I would also not be satisfied with neither (False).
- You need to give me  _both_  conditions, for me to be satisfied (True).

For example:

```
a = 4
b = 5

(a == 4) and (b == 5)
>>> True

(a == 3) and (b == 5)
>>> False

(a == 4) and (b == 4)
>>> False
```

## The `or` Operator

If I wanted an apple  _or_ a banana, I would be fine with you giving me either, or both:	 

no apple, no banana →  `False`
no apple, banana → `True`
apple, no banana →  `True`
apple, banana →  `True`

```
a = 4
b = 5

(a == 4) or (b == 5)
>>> True

(a == 3) or (b == 5)
>>> True

(a == 3) or (b == 4)
>>> False
```

## The `not` Operator

The `not` reverses the value:

`not True` → `False`
`not False` → `True`

```
a = 4

b = 5

not ((a == 4) or (b == 5))
> False

(a == 4) and (not(b == 6))
> True

```

# Conditionals with Strings

We can use both numbers and strings in our conditionals.

When two strings are **exactly the same**, Python considers them equal (`==`).

```
a = “hello world”
b = “HELLO WORLD”

print(a == b)
>>> False

print(a == “hello world”)
>>> True

print(a != b)
>>> True
```

## Let’s Practice

Evaluate if the expression is True or False:

> Remember: The order of precedence is parenthesis > `not` > `and` > `or`

`True and True or False`

`(5 != 0) or (0 != 0)`

`not (27/3 + 3 == 3*2*4/2)`

`False or False and True`

`not (25/(13+12) != 1) and True`

## Try it yourself

Write a program which asks the user two integers: the length and width of a rectangle. The program then tells the user whether the rectangle is a square or not.

Example output:

```
length: 10
width: 20
>>> not a square
```

```
length: 25
width: 25
>>> Square
```

```
length: 0
width: -10
>>> Not a square
```

# Else and Else If Statements

Else if statements come after if statements and use the `elif` keyword
`elif`: “if the previous conditions were `False`, try this condition:”


```
if (A):    
# Do this if A is True
elif (B):
# Do this if A is False, but B is True


elif (C):    # Do this if A and B is False, but C is True
```

You can use an else statement for anything that does not satisfy all preceding conditions.

```
if (A):
# Do this if A is True
elif (B):
# Do this if A is False, but B is True
else:
# Do this if everything else is False```
```

## Try it yourself

Write a program that accepts passwords from the user, and tells the user whether the password matches with the one stored inside.

> **Important: Don't put any of your actual passwords, repl projects are public!**

Ex. if my password is the string `"EggsAndSpam123"`:



```
Enter a password: Hello World 
>>> Not correct

Enter a password: SpamAndEggs
>>> Not correct

Enter a password: eggsandspam123
>>> Not correct

Enter a password: EggsAndSpam123
>>> Correct
```

# Nested `if` statements

You can write `if` statements inside of other `if` statements.

This is called a **nested `if`**


```python
if (a):
	# a is True
	if (b):
		# b is True	
	else:		
		# b is False
else:	
	# a is False
```

* First, the program checks for the condition in the outside if.
* if a is True, it will execute the code inside the if
  * This causes it to look inside the inner if
* if a is False, it will skip the inside and never check if b is True

## Try it yourself

Write a program to test if a given year is a leap year or not.

A leap year is defined under the following conditions:
- The year is divisible by 4
- However, if the year is a century year (1800, 1900, 2000), it must be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year
	- Hint: You can use `%` to check whether a number is divisible by another

```
Enter a year: 1900
>>> not a leap year

Enter a year: 2000 
>>> leap year

Enter a year: 2016
>>> leap year

Enter a year: 2021
>>> not a leap year
```

# What can we make?

Now that you’ve learned conditionals, you can do many more useful things with programming. One of them could be a simple 4 function calculator.

You can look at the repl.it [here](https://replit.com/@liuj05/5-Conditionals-Programming) as an example.

Using the code provided in this repl, make modifications to it:

1. Add the modulus function to this calculator
2. Add the power function (exponent) to this calculator
3. Change it so that it can accept floats as its input
